    "### Background:\n",
    "#### Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",

    "#### To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "### Data Provided:\n",
    "#### ‚Ä¢ The theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X\n",
    "#### ‚Ä¢ Sample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050\n",
    "#### ‚Ä¢ Number of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (Œº) of 600 units and a standard deviation (œÉ) of 25 units\n"
